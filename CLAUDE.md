# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Next Friday 13th** is a Vue 3 web application that displays when the next Friday the 13th will occur, along with related information and fun facts. It's a static single-page application built with Vite, Vue 3, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Common Commands

### Development
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start the development server (runs on http://localhost:5173 by default)

### Building & Deployment
- `npm run build` - Create optimized production build in `dist/` folder
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally

## Architecture & Code Organization

### File Structure
```
src/
├── main.js          # Vue app initialization
├── App.vue          # Root component (contains all logic)
├── style.css        # Tailwind + global styles
└── nextfriday13th.css   # Additional custom styles
```

### Key Design Patterns

**Single Component Architecture**: All logic is contained in `App.vue` (src/App.vue). The component uses Vue 3's Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax.

**Core Date Logic**: The `App.vue` component contains utility functions for Friday the 13th calculations:
- `isFriday13th(date)` - Checks if a date is Friday the 13th (getDay() === 5 && getDate() === 13)
- `findNextFriday13th(startDate)` - Finds next Friday 13th by iterating through months, checks up to 2 years ahead
- `findAllFriday13thsInYear(year)` - Finds all Friday 13ths in a specific year
- Date formatting utilities: `formatDate()` for long format, `formatDateShort()` for short format

**Computed Properties**: Uses Vue's computed() for reactive calculations:
- `isTodayFriday13th` - Boolean indicating if today is Friday the 13th
- `nextFriday13th` - The next Friday 13th date
- `daysUntilNext` - Days until next occurrence
- `friday13thsThisYear` - Array of all Friday 13ths in current year
- `funFact` - Random fun fact (cycled by month)

**Time Updates**: The component uses `onMounted()` to set an interval that updates the `today` ref every 60 seconds (60000ms).

### Styling Architecture

**Tailwind CSS Integration**:
- Built with `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` via PostCSS
- Custom color palette defined in `tailwind.config.js` under `spooky.*` namespace (spooky-darkest, spooky-dark, spooky-accent, spooky-blood, spooky-orange, etc.)
- Custom animations: `pulse-slow`, `float`, `spooky-glow` with keyframe definitions
- Font family: `font-creepy` uses Courier New monospace

**Style Files**:
- `style.css` - Imported in main.js, contains Tailwind directives and global styles
- `nextfriday13th.css` - Additional custom styles (appears to be legacy/supplementary)

## Deployment

The `dist/` folder generated by `npm run build` can be deployed to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.). The domain is `www.nextfriday13th.com`.
